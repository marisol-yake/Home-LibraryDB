## The Home Library Database project!

### What is it? 
The Home Library Database is an organized catalog of information about books in our home library!  

### Why?
We set out to create the Home Library Database project because we have a lot of books and not a lot of ways to organize or catalog them. By creating the Home Library Database, we hope to make our library easier to maintain, access, change, and update.
